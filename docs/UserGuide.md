# NetConnect User Guide

NetConnect is a desktop app for managing contacts in SMEs, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It enables HR and relations managers to efficiently manage their employees, clients, as well as suppliers, **all in one place** ☝🏻.

The inspiration behind NetConnect lies in solving a specific set of challenges faced by the food business managers demographic. Specifically, we aim to address the challenge of managing various contact types: clients, suppliers, and employees.

If you relate to this problem we identified, then NetConnect might be just right for you. This user guide will accompany you in maximising the capabilities of this product, freeing time for more pressing issues.

# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `netconnect.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your NetConnect.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar netconnect.jar` command
   to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 r/employee` : Adds an employee
      named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

    * `delete i/3` : Deletes the contact with ID 3 from NetConnect.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts. (We caution against doing this until you have fully experimented with the sample
      contacts provided.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<section id="find">

## Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose information matches any of the specified parameters. You can find persons by names, phone numbers, tags, roles, and remarks. To search via different fields, you can stack multiple `find`-type commands to narrow down your search.

Format: `find [n/NAME]... [t/TAG]... [p/PHONE_NUMBER]... [role/ROLE]... [r/REMARK]...`

* Only one type of field is allowed for each `find` command.
* Multiple parameters of the same field can be provided, showing persons who match any of the field in that command, e.g. `find n/alex n/david` will show all persons with either `alex` or `david` in their names.
* `list` is required to remove the stacked filters.
* Searches are case-insensitive, e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`.
* Partial matches are allowed for names, e.g. `Ha` will match `Hans`.
* Find by remark requires full word match that is contained in the remark sentence, e.g. `find r/marketing` will match `r/marketing IC`, `find r/has dog` will match `r/he has a dog`, `find r/market` will **not** match `r/marketing`.
* Find by remark requires all words given to be contained in the remark sentence, e.g. `find r/has cute dog` will **not** match ` r/he has a dog`.
* Find by remark allows unordered search, e.g. `find r/dog has` will match `r/he has a dog`.
* `find r/` will search for contacts with an empty remark.
* For phone numbers, tags and role, only exact matches are allowed, e.g. `83647382` or `8364` will not match `83641001`, `find t/fri` will not match contacts with tag `friends`, `find role/clie` will not match contacts with role `client`.

Find by name example:
* `find n/John` returns `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find n/alex n/david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`.<br>
![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

Find by tag example:
* `find t/friends` returns all persons who have the tag `friends`.

Find by phone number example:
* `find p/98765432` returns `John Doe` who has the phone number `98765432`.

Find by role example:
* `find role/client` returns all persons who have the role `client`.
* `find role/supplier role/client` returns all persons who have the role `supplier` or `client`.

Find by remark example:
* `find r/` returns all persons who have an empty remark.
* `find r/has a dog` returns all persons who have the remark `has a dog`.
* `find r/dog` returns all persons who have the remark `has a dog`.
* `find r/a has` returns all persons who have the remark `has a dog`.

Stacking find by name and tag example

<section id="clear">

## Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

**Warnings:** Due to the destructive nature of this action, NetConnect will require a confirmation from the user before it is executed.

</section>

<section id="relate">

## Create Relations between Profiles : `relate`

Creates a relation between two profiles in the address book.

Format: `relate i/ID i/ID`

Example: `relate i/1 i/2` creates a relation between the profiles with ID of 1 and 2.

</section>

<section id="showrelated">

## Show Relations Associated to a Person : `showrelated`

Shows all the relations associated to a person in the address book.

Format: `showrelated i/ID`

Example: `showrelated i/1` shows all relations between the profile with ID 1 and all other contacts.

**Info:** If there are no persons related to the provided ID, the interface will show `0 persons listed`.

</section>

<section id="open-on-last-state">

## Open on Last State
With every change to the command input, NetConnect saves and updates the command input in a separate file. When the app closes and is opened again, the last command present before closure will be retrieved from the separate file and input into the command field (if any). This way, you never have to worry about losing progress!

</section>

<section id="export">

## Export Current View to CSV File : `export`
Retrieve information on a group of profiles at once with this function! This can be useful for consolidating all the emails or contact number at once, or to share information with third parties.

**To export _all_ profiles in the address book to a CSV file:**

Step 1: `list`

Step 2: `export`

* The `list` command in the first step is to pull all profiles into the current view.

**To export a _specific_ group of profiles to a CSV file:**

Step 1: `find [KEYWORD]` or any other function that filters the profiles.

Step 2: `export`

* The first step is to filter the profiles you want to export into the current view.

</section>

<section id="birthday">

## Never Miss a Birthday!
Celebrate your employees' birthdays to show that you care. NetConnect will remind you of the birthdays of your employees, so you never have to miss a birthday again!

</section>

<section id="exit-program">

## Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

</section>

<section id="saving-the-data">

## Saving the data

NetConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

</section>

<section id="editing-the-data-file">

## Editing the data file

NetConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/netconnect.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NetConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br> Furthermore, certain edits can cause the NetConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</section>

# Future Implementations
The NetConnect team is working on new features and fixes for you, but they are unfortunately unavailable in this current implementation. We intend to have future fixes for these occurences below!

1. When invoking showrelated on a id that does not exist, the error message will be `Contact not found` instead of `0 persons listed`.

## Truncate text in GUI
Current implementation of NetConnect GUI is able to accommodate input of approximately 120 characters for the profile fields (name, tags, etc.) in fullscreen mode. Additional text are represented by ellipsis. Future implementations will include a feature to truncate text responsively according to the screen size in the GUI to prevent overflow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous NetConnect home folder.

**Q**: How do I know if Java 11 is already installed on my computer?
**A**: Open the Command Prompt (Windows) or the Terminal (MacOS) and run the `java -version` command. The output should contain Java 11 if it is installed.

**Q**: What if I have newer versions of Java already installed on my computer?
**A**: You will still need Java 11 to run NetConnect, though multiple versions should be fine. You may check this using the `java -version` command. The output should contain Java 11 if it is installed.

**Q**: What operating systems can I use NetConnect on?
**A**: NetConnect can be run on Linux, Windows, and macOS, provided that Java 11 is installed.

**Q**: Do I require the internet to run the application?
**A**: No, you do not need the internet to access our application or its features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
